# NFT-Price-Prediction-Challenge
The goal of this competition is to build a model that predicts the price of NFTs based on a select group of their attributes that are publicly accessible and also based on their social media activity.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have become not only one of the most popular ways for creators to sell their artistic content worldwide, but also a common investment vehicle in general. A prestigious brokerage for modern and contemporary art wants to move deeper into the digital space, and believes that NFT investments will become even more popular as the number of them proliferates in the market, despite the economic headwind likely to emerge in the near future.

That said, it's a common notion that NFT pricing is largely driven by speculation rather than an underlying value such as earnings or future cashflow in traditional investments (e.g. stocks, real estate). This unique characteristic is one of the challenges for the art brokerage in choosing the right NFTs to feature in their auctions, leading to the question of whether the fluctuations in price follow some sort of pattern or not (think about the technical analysis on cryptocurrencies). The company would like some kind of tool to evaluate the NFTs that pique their interest.

This competition was hosted on bitgrit website.
